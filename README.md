# App-React-Native-E-commerce

The project I developed using React Native technology is a mobile application offering an optimized user experience for online sales. It is designed to work on two separate interfaces, one for customers and another for administrators.

The first interface allows customers to browse the different products available on the application, add them to their basket, finalize their purchase and consult their purchase history. Additionally, they can also view product details such as their price, availability, and specifications.

The second interface, reserved for administrators, allows them to manage orders placed by customers. They can view paid orders, details of each order, and customer history. They can also access customers' personal information such as their address and phone number.

The app was built using React Native, a technology that allows developing mobile apps for iOS and Android platforms using JavaScript. This technology offers great flexibility to develop a dynamic and responsive user interface.
